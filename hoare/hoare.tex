Hoare starts out by deriving some simple sentences from axioms of the
integers. Then, he points out that rigorizing a program is a bit
harder, and gives a toy example to show it is possible.

\section{Arguments for why it is important to formally prove a program correct}

\begin{itemize}
\item (Reliability) Logical correctness is the strongest form of testing.
\item (Documentation) A proof is completely rigorous documentation that may explain
  not only how a program works, but why it works.
\item (Compatibility) Formal proofs may facilitate refactoring and dealing with
  platform dependencies. Imagine if you have an axiomatic derivation
  of a program. You can quickly determine whether this program will
  work on a different computing platform by seeing whether it uses
  axioms specific to that platform.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, axiomatizing a programming language can aid in the design
of new languages.

\begin{itemize}
\item Languages designed with a form proof system in mind can leave
  nitty gritty details undefined, which ought not belong in a language
  specification anyway..
\item Languages designed from an axiomatic basis will be more
  clearheaded because proofs provide a clear organizing principal.
\end{itemize}
